= What is Eclipse MicroProfile

Eclipse MicroProfile, an open source specification for Enterprise Java microservices, is an innovation project whose goal is to work on microservices patterns for Enterprise Java and integrate applications with the infrastructures they run on, i.e. a cloud environment, with patterns like health checks, metrics, etc. As of this writing, Eclipse MicroProfile leverages 3 Java EE APIs and also includes 1 non-Java-EE API (MicroProfile Configuration 1.0).  Eclipse MicroProfile roadmap calls for the addition of 4 more non-Java-EE API specification by the end of 2017. Some of these non-Java-EE APIs may be submitted as Java Specification Requests (JSRs) for inclusion into the Java EE standard. Eclipse MicroProfile follows a time-boxed rapid incremental release schedule. Lastly, one key aspect of Eclipse MicroProfile is that it is managed and governed by the community and not a single vendor.
