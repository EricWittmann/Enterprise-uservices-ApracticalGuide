= History of MicroProfile

Java EE has been an extremely successful platform. The Java Community Process (JCP) has been the steward of over 20 compatible implementations over its nearly 20 year history, resulting in a $4B industry. However, Oracle management of Java EE (unintentional or not) stalled innovations and while other standards have developed, the Java community worldwide, and CIOs at all major enterprises desired an open standard for Java within their enterprise.

In its early stages, J2EE grew somewhat quickly between J2EE 1.2 up to J2EE 1.4 as the platform needed to address the immediate needs of the enterprise. Beginning with Java EE 5 in May 2006, the pace began to slow as the platform began to mature to  3 years and 6 months in between releases. However, after Java EE 7, which was released on June 12, 2013, there has been a long delay in its development. Java EE 8 was formally launched in September of 2014 at JavaOne, where Oracle announced that it would be completed by JavaOne 2016. But then on June 2015, Oracle updated its release date to the first half of 2017. And again, at JavaOne 2016 (September), Oracle revised the Java EE 8 release date to the end of 2017. Java EE 8 was finally released on September 21, 2017 at JavaOne.

Java EE has been following the slower release cadence that a standards organization typically reflects. A standards-based release cadence by design does not address rapid innovations. And while this was occurring, the Digital Economy happened, which brought about the popularity and rising use of cloud, containers, agile methodologies, DevOps, continuous integration and continuous delivery, microservices, API management, and open source projects (Red Hat has been successful in delivering many of these solutions to the marketplace). The slowdown in Java EE releases (and maturity) opened the door to competing technologies that were able to fulfill the needs and requirements of Digital Businesses, such as Spring, Node.js, for example.

Moreover, in answer to the slowdown in Java EE maturity, many vendors, Java champions, Java User Groups, and corporations got together and announced the Eclipse MicroProfile back in June 2016.
