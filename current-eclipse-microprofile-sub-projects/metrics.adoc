= Metrics

Telemetry exposes metrics of the running server like CPU and Memory usage, thread count and others. Those are then often fed into charting systems to visualize the metrics over time or serve for capacity planning purposes.

The Java Virtual machine has a way to expose data for a long time via MBeans and the MBeanServer. Since Java SE 6, there is even an (RMI based) remote protocol defined for all VMs on how to access the MBean Server from remote processes.

Dealing with this protocol is difficult and does not fit in todayâ€™s http-based interactions. The other pain point is that many of the existing servers have different properties exposed under different names. It is thus not easy to set up monitoring of different kinds of servers.

MicroProfile has created a monitoring specification that addresses the above two points via a http-based API for access by monitoring agents and a Java API that allows exporting application-specific metrics.

There are three scopes for metrics within the specification:

* Base: those are metrics, mostly JVM statistics, that every compliant vendor has to support.
* Vendor: optional vendor-specific metrics that are not portable.
* Application: optional metrics from deployed applications. The Java-API will be shown below.
